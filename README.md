In [Project 1](https://rpubs.com/Seymour22/biofunctional_polymer_prevents_retinal_scarring) I use DeSeq2 to extract differential expressed genes in epithelial cells treated under four conditions: Media only control, Polymer alone, TNF-α and TGF-β1 (TNT) alone, TNT + Polymer. The purpose of this pipeline is to replicate the results published by [Parikh et al., 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35589753/) which showed that upregulation of genes that are important for the NRF2 signalling pathway is associated with the presence of the polymer and not necessarily TNT.
