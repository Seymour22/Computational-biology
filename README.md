In [Project 1](https://rpubs.com/Seymour22/biofunctional_polymer_prevents_retinal_scarring) I use DeSeq2 to extract differential expressed genes in epithelial cells treated under four conditions: Media only control, Polymer alone, TNF-α and TGF-β1 (TNT) alone, TNT + Polymer. The purpose of this pipeline is to replicate the results published by [Parikh et al., 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35589753/) which showed that upregulation of genes that are important for the NRF2 signalling pathway is associated with the presence of the polymer and not necessarily TNT.


In [Project 2](https://rpubs.com/Seymour22/1140801) I use Plink to perform a genome-wide association study to pinpoint the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to hippocampal atrophy in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The investigation utilizes genetic data extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.


Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf
